# Doodle SVG

An SVG backend for [Doodle](https://creativescala.org/doodle), targeting both the JVM and JS platforms.

See [the microsite](https://creativescala.org/doodle-svg) for documentation.

This used to be part of the Doodle main distribution but it was difficult to support as dependencies upgrade at different rates. Extracting here allows updates to be independent of the main project.
